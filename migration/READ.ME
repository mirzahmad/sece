we use flyway db for migration. 
runt his command to migrate 'gralde flywayMigrate' from this folder
it will migrate any outstanding files in sql-migrations folder. 
When you pull changes from git remote repo see if any new files created in sql-migrations folder, if so then run 'gralde flywayMigrate' command to sync db. when you have new changes to commit run the following command: 'gradle flywayInfo' which will tell you what is the version of the db. Once you know create a script in this format:
migration-current_version+1-yourname.sql.
for example current version is 568 then script will be:
migration-569-mirza.sql. 

'gradle flywayInfo' command will also tell if there are any outstanding sql files that need to run.
